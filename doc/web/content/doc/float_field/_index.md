## Float Field

In general, a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) if
defined in terms of a
[field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)). This definitions
breaks down when we try to define vector spaces for computer arithmetic. The
primary reason is that neither the integers nor the floating point numbers as
specified by [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) satisfy the
definition of a field. Hence, for the purposes of defining vector spaces for
computer arithmetic, it would be beneficial to introduce a concept which takes
these factors into account. Right now, nature of such a concept is unclear, but
the definition will evolve over time.
